To solve \cref{eq:rotating liouville,eq:radiated envelope} for each of $N_s$ \qds{} at $N_t$ equally-spaced timesteps, we begin with a suitable representation of $\tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}, t)$ in terms of spatial and temporal basis functions, i.e.~
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}, t) \equiv \sum_{\ell=0}^{N_s - 1} \sum_{m = 0}^{N_t - 1} \alpha_{\ell m} \vb{S}_\ell(\vb{r}) T_m(t).
  \label{eq:basis function representation}
\end{equation}
where $T_m(t) \equiv T(t - m \, \Delta t)$.
As the wavelength of any radiation in the system far exceeds the dimensions of the \qds{} under consideration, we take $\vb{S}_\ell(\vb{r}) \equiv \vb{d}_\ell \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_\ell)$.
Such a discretization has the additional benefit of discretizing \cref{eq:rotating liouville}, forming a set of $N_s$ first-order differential equations coupled through radiative processes.
Furthermore, we require $T(t)$ to have causal and interpolatory properties so as to recover $\tilde{\vb{P}}$, $\partial_t \tilde{\vb{P}}$, and $\partial^2_t \tilde{\vb{P}}$ at the current timestep. 
Consequently, we have elected to use a set of backwards-looking Lagrange polynomials of order $\ge 4$, forming temporal basis functions similar to the one shown in \cref{fig:interpolation basis}.

The finite support of the basis functions as well as the causality of $T(t)$ mean \cref{eq:basis function representation,eq:radiated envelope} combine to produce a lower-triangular block Toeplitz matrix relating the $\alpha_{\ell m}$ to $\tilde{\vb{E}}(\vb{r}_{\ell'}, m' \, \Delta t)$---the electric field envelope at each \qd{} for every timestep in the simulation.
Solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} then amounts to an iterative procedure of using this matrix to produce $\tilde{\vb{E}}(\vb{r}_\ell, m \, \Delta t)$ at the current timesep, followed by one step of an ODE solution to predict $\vb{P}$ one step in the future.
For this, we make use of the predictor/corrector scheme detailed in~\cite{Glaser2009} due to its extreme accuracy and inherent bandlimitedness.
Approximating $\hat{\rho}_i(t)$ as a weighted sum of complex exponentials, the predictor/corrector scheme proceeds with an extrapolation predictor step,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_i(t_{k + 1}) \coloneqq \sum_{\ell = 1}^k \mathcal{P}_\ell^{\qty(0)} \hat{\rho}_i(t_\ell) + \mathcal{P}_\ell^{\qty(1)} \dot{\hat{\rho}}_i(t_\ell),
  \label{eq:predictor}
\end{equation}
and several iterated corrector steps,
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_i(t_{k + 1}) \coloneqq \mathcal{C}_{k+1}^{\qty(1)} \dot{\hat{\rho}}_i(t_{k + 1}) + \sum_{\ell = 1}^k \mathcal{C}_\ell^{\qty(0)} \hat{\rho}_i(t_i) + \mathcal{C}_\ell^{\qty(1)} \dot{\hat{\rho}}_i(t_\ell).
  \label{eq:corrector}
\end{equation}
where the $\mathcal{P}_\ell^{\qty(0, 1)}$ and $\mathcal{C}_\ell^{\qty(0, 1)}$ coefficients arise from a least-squares solution to a system of complex-valued exponentials on a semidisk in the left complex plane.

The approximation used in \cref{eq:rotating liouville} facilitates large timesteps that encompass many \qds{}.
These dots interact continuously over each timestep, thus a suitable integrator should accommodate multiple scattering events occurring within the same time interval---a feat accomplished naturally through iterated applications of \cref{eq:corrector}.
Moreover, the coupling term in \cref{eq:hamiltonian} and the retardation factor in \cref{eq:total field} add significant complexities, making ``straightforward'' solution methods (such as RK4 or other midstep methods) ill-suited for the problem at hand.
The necessity of a midstep RHS evaluation in RK4 schemes, for instance, proves troublesome; as the RHS to evaluate a given $\dot{\hat{\rho}}_i$ between timesteps depends on every other $\hat{\rho}_j$ at the same timepoint, the system requires either an infinite number of step subdivisions or some sort of extrapolation scheme to advance by $\Delta t$.
As the predictor/corrector method presented here possesses superior accuracy properties alongside a rigorous extrapolation scheme (by construction), it very naturally solves the system described by \cref{eq:rotating liouville,eq:radiated envelope}.

%\subsection{Evaluation of radiated fields}
\begin{figure}

  \caption{\label{fig:interpolation}Illustration of interpolation with four basis polynomials.
    An assumed signal takes $1.5\Delta t$ to travel from between points.
    Evaluations of the basis polynomials (and their derivatives) need only occur once between each pair of points (red dots) due to their translational invariance.
    The interpolated signal then becomes a sum of these values weighted by the known samples (black dots).

\end{figure}

To evaluate \cref{eq:radiated envelope} between every pair of points we make use of variable-order Lagrange interpolation scheme.
Such a scheme easily accommodates both retardation effects between \qds{} separated by a non-integer number of timesteps as well as the first and second time derivatives of $\vb{P}$.
To make the interpolation calculation as efficient as possible at each timestep, we store only an history index (integer) and several interpolation coefficients (complex doubles) for every pair of \qds{}.
The history index corresponds to $\lfloor \abs{\Delta \vb{r}}/(c \, \Delta t) \rfloor$ and gives the start of the ``interpolation window'' used to reconstruct $\tilde{E}$ (\cref{fig:interpolation}).
The interpolation coefficients hold $\vb{d}_i \cdot \tilde{\vb{E}}_\text{rad} \cdot \vb{d}_j$ for an interpolatory representation of the integrand in \cref{eq:radiated envelope} (i.e.\ $\tilde{\vb{P}}$ becomes the basis polynomials evaluated at the correct time and contains none of the system dynamics).
