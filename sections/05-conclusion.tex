\section{\label{section:conclusion}Conclusions \& future work}
Here we developed a robust, fine-grained algorithm to solve for the dynamics of an ensemble of \qds{} that couple in response to external light fields.
By making use of an integral equation kernel to propagate radiated fields, our model facilitates simulations of thousands of \qds{} in three dimensions with accurate bookkeeping of both near and far radiation fields.
Our simulations predict a ``suppression'' effect between adjacent \qds{} that screens out the incident laser pulse;
we interpret this effect as a dynamical detuning that shifts the effective $\omega_0$ of the affected \qds{} and observe additional oscillatory behavior in clusters of more particles.
\textcolor{red}{These effects could prove useful in\ldots}
Additionally, in larger systems of densely-packed \qds{}, we see significant \textcolor{red}{localization effects} that present as regions of enhanced polarization over lengthscales comparable to that of the incident wavelength.
\textcolor{blue}{Anything else to say?}


Current semi-classical Maxwell-Bloch techniques predict superradiant effects~\cite{Gross1982} within a continuum formulation.
We expect that our approach---when extended to systems containing millions of \qds{}---will aid in investigating the role of many-dot interactions in these phenomena.
Unfortunately, the na\"ive $\mathcal{O}\qty(n^2)$ interaction calculation presented here hampers attempts to extend these calculations to such systems.
Our ongoing research includes the development of accelerated computational techniques that exploit the structure of $\mathcal{Z}$ to reduce the big-$\mathcal{O}$ scaling of \cref{eq:zmatrix}.
Additionally, the technique presented here readily extends to model atomic \& molecular systems with richer structure---such as energy degeneracies or biexcitonic transitions---that we hope to investigate soon.
