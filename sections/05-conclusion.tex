\section{\label{section:conclusion}Conclusions \& future work}
Here we developed a robust, fine-grained algorithm to solve for the dynamics of an ensemble of \qds{} that couple in response to external light fields.
By making use of an integral equation kernel to propagate radiated fields, our model facilitates simulations of thousands of \qds{} in three dimensions with accurate bookkeeping of both near and far radiation fields.
Our simulations predict a ``suppression'' effect between adjacent \qds{} that screens out the incident laser pulse and we interpret this effect as a dynamical detuning that shifts the effective $\omega_0$ of the affected \qds{}.
Moreover, we observe additional oscillatory behavior and localization effects in larger clusters of particles.
These effects could prove useful to identify optically quantum dot ``molecules'' in an extended sample by detecting residual localized polarization following integral $\pi$ pulse(s).
Finally, in larger systems of densely-packed \qds{}, we see significant localization that present as regions of enhanced polarization over length scales comparable to that of the incident wavelength.

Current semi-classical Maxwell-Bloch techniques predict superradiant effects within a continuum formulation~\cite{Gross1982,PhysRevA.4.302,PhysRevA.4.854}.
We expect that our approach---when extended to systems containing a larger number of \qds{}---will aid in investigating the role of many-dot interactions in systems such as nanolasers~\cite{jahnke2016giant} that exploit these phenomena.
Unfortunately, the na\"ive $\mathcal{O}\qty(N_s^2)$ interaction calculation presented here hampers attempts to extend these calculations to systems with $N_s \gg 10^4$.
Our ongoing research includes the development of accelerated computational techniques that exploit the structure of $\mathcal{Z}$ to reduce the big-$\mathcal{O}$ scaling of \cref{eq:zmatrix}.
Additionally, the technique presented here readily extends to model atomic, molecular, and semiconductor systems with richer structure (e.g.\ energy degeneracies or biexcitonic transitions).
