Here we detail the results of several investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thusfar.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume at densities similar to those found in experiments, and \cref{table:parameters} gives approximate values of the system parameters.

  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and identical \qds{} amidst 1022 neighboring particles.
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly lessened response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (not shown for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscilliatory modes in the evolution of \qd{} clusters shown here in gray.

  \caption{\label{fig:polarization vis}Spatial distribution of polarization (indicated by $\abs{\tilde{\rho}_{01}}$ in both size and color) after a $\pi$-pulse has excited the system.
  While the distribution of $\abs{\vb{P}}$ varies significantly between dots, the regions of distinctly high and low polarization indicate localization phenomena arising from their electromagnetic interaction.}
