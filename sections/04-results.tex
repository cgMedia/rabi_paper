\section{Results}
Presents some cases of (i) energy exchange, (ii) screening, (iii) flashy plots of the electric field with localisation.
Show that all the effects need the presence of the many dots and disapper in the case of two dots.

  \caption{\label{fig:population dynamics}Population dynamics of 512 interacting \qds{}.
    The majority of the \qds{} follow a trajectory prescribed by the incident pulse; several pairs of dots, however, become strongly correlated due to the small distance between particles.
