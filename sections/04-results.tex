Here we detail the results of investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thus far.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume at densities similar to those found in experiments, and \cref{table:parameters} gives approximate values of the system parameters.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and a 1024-particle neighborhood (dots (1) and (2) maintain their separation and orientation between simulations).
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly diminished response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (omitted for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscillatory modes in the evolution of selected \qds{} (shown in gray).
    Note that $\rho_{00}^{\qty(1)}$ and $\rho_{00}^{\qty(2)}$ appear to have \emph{two} coherent modes in the presence of multiple dots: a high-frequency oscillation between the pair, as well as a low-frequency oscillation of the group about a decaying envelope.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:density stats} details $\rho_{00}(t)$ for one-, two-, and 1024-particle simulations.
The \qds{} fill a $\SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter}$ box; experience a \SI{1}{\pico\second} laser pulse calibrated as a so-called ``$\pi$-pulse'' for perfectly resonant, undamped \qds{}; and otherwise use the parameters given in \cref{table:parameters}.
The two-particle simulations produce significant departures from the trajectories predicted by solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} with a prescribed external $\tilde{\vb{E}}_0(\vb{r}, t)$ alone.
The interaction between two \qds{} consistently screens the external field leading to a greatly diminished Rabi rotation response without notable oscillations.
The results of larger simulations appear considerably more interesting (\cref{fig:density stats}(b)) due to the presence of many-dot interactions.
The highlighted trajectories in \cref{fig:density stats}(b) contain a number of frequency components not present in the incident radiation or the dynamics of a two-particle system.
Moreover, the shaded neighbor $\rho_{00}(t)$ show many-body coupling interactions (in the curves with distinct oscillations) as well as additional screening effects (in the curves that deviate very little from $1$).

%\Cref{fig:polarization vis} details the polarization distribution in a large-scale \textcolor{red}{Replace with 10k figure---simulations in progress} simulation in both space and time.
%Here, ten thousand \qds{} randomly fill a $\SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter}$ box and inherit the remainder of their parameters from the simulation detailed above.
%This simulation contains coupling/screening features similar to those in \cref{fig:density stats},
%though \cref{fig:visit} further reveals the mechanism behind these phenomena.
%Regions of high polarization (indicated as large points) appear clustered together, suggesting the coupling/screening behavior depends strongly on the geometry or ``randomness'' of a particular region: \qds{} in regions of anomalously high density demonstrate significantly richer behavior---a proximity induced localization effect.

%Borrowing from standard measures of localization (in which one calculates various integrals of $\vb{E}$ over the simulation volume), we have adapted the inverse participation ratio (IPR)  of the dot polarization as
%\begin{equation}
  %\text{IPR}(t) = \frac{\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^4}{\qty(\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^2)^2}
  %\label{eq:ipr}
%\end{equation}
%to provide a quantitative description of these phenomena.
%\Cref{fig:ipr} shows this quantity for the system in \cref{fig:polarization vis}.
%The maximum IPR occurs some time after the pulse has passed through the system, suggesting strongly coupled \qds{} retain their polarization longer than their uncoupled neighbors. Moreover, this dynamical localization effect features oscillations, indicating that many-dot effects contribute to the dynamics within a relatively narrow spectral region.

While the behavior observed in \cref{fig:density stats}(b) arises largely from the short range $\vb{r}^{-3}$ term in \cref{eq:radiated envelope}, we also observe features arising from the $\vb{r}^{-1}$ term in larger simulations.
\Cref{fig:tubes,fig:xy tube projection} depict $\abs{\rho_{01}(\vb{r})}^2$ for \num{10000} \qds{} distributed randomly throughout a right cylinder.

    The cylinder experiences a Gaussian pulse of width $\sigma = \SI{1}{\pico\second}$ and wavelength $\lambda = \SI{0.827}{\micro\meter}$.
    The outlier blue/red particles correspond to adjacent \qds{} that couple strongly due to the $\vb{r}^{-3}$ term in \cref{eq:radiated envelope}.
    The $\vb{r}^{-1}$ term also produces variations in $\abs{\tilde{\rho}_{01}}^2$ on the order of $\lambda$, seen here as regions of enhanced and suppressed polarization (most apparent at the ends of the cylinder).

    The uniform orientation of the dipole radiators breaks the cylindrical symmetry of the system, leading to radial anisotropies in the polarization intensity.
