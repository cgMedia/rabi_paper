\section{Numerical Results}
Here we detail the results of several investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thusfar.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a cubic simulation volume at various densities.
\Cref{table:parameters} gives approximate values of the system parameters.

  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of 1024 \qds{} at low and high number densities ($n$).
  The colored lines depict sufficiently unique trajectories while the shaded gray regions outline the remainder of the 1024 population curves.
  At moderate $n$ (top) and below, the \qds{} follow a curve largely prescribed by the incident pulse with only a few screening/coupling events.
  Higher densities (bottom) exhibit significantly more coupling and screening groups with a wider range of oscillation frequencies.

  \caption{\label{fig:polarization vis}Spatial distribution of polarization (indicated by $\abs{\tilde{\rho}_{01}}$ in both size and color) after a $\pi$-pulse has excited the system.
  While the distribution of $\abs{\vb{P}}$ varies significantly between dots, the regions of distinctly high and low polarization indicate localization phenomena arising from their electromagnetic interaction.}
