Here we detail the results of investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thus far.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume experiencing a laser pulse of the form
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0(\vb{r}, t) = \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{-(\vb{k}_L \cdot \vb{r} - \omega_L t)^2/(2\sigma^2)}.
  \label{eq:pulse envelope}
\end{equation}
\Cref{table:parameters} provides the physical system parameters unless otherwise stated.


\begin{figure}
  \input{figures/density_stats}
  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and a 1024-particle neighborhood (dots (1) and (2) maintain their separation and orientation between simulations).
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly diminished response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (omitted for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscillatory modes in the evolution of selected \qds{} (shown in gray).
    Note that $\rho_{00}^{\qty(1)}$ and $\rho_{00}^{\qty(2)}$ appear to have \emph{two} coherent modes in the presence of multiple dots: a high-frequency oscillation between the pair, as well as a low-frequency oscillation of the group about a decaying envelope.
}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:density stats} details $\rho_{00}(t)$ for one-, two-, and 1024-particle simulations.
The \qds{} fill a $\SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter}$ box; experience a \SI{1}{\pico\second} laser pulse calibrated as a so-called $\pi$-pulse for perfectly resonant, undamped \qds{}.
The two-particle simulations produce significant departures from the trajectories predicted by solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} with a prescribed external $\tilde{\vb{E}}_0(\vb{r}, t)$ alone.
The interaction between two \qds{} consistently screens the external field leading to a greatly diminished Rabi rotation response without notable oscillations.
The results of larger simulations appear considerably more interesting (\cref{fig:density stats}(b)) due to the presence of many-dot interactions.
The highlighted trajectories in \cref{fig:density stats}(b) contain a number of frequency components not present in the incident radiation or the dynamics of a two-particle system.
Moreover, the shaded neighbor $\rho_{00}(t)$ show many-body coupling interactions (in the curves with distinct oscillations) as well as additional screening effects (in the curves that deviate very little from $1$).

  \caption{\label{fig:polarization vis}
    1024 \qds{} illuminated by a $\pi$-pulse largely follow a trajectory determined by the pulse, though exceptionally close pairs/groups can maintain a polarized state far longer than the rest of the system.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:polarization vis} details the polarization distribution in a simulation in both space and time.
Here, ten thousand \qds{} randomly fill a $\SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter}$ box and inherit the remainder of their parameters from the simulation detailed above.
This simulation contains coupling/screening features similar to those in \cref{fig:density stats},
though \cref{fig:visit} further reveals the mechanism behind these phenomena.
Regions of high polarization (indicated as large points) appear clustered together, suggesting the coupling/screening behavior depends strongly on the geometry or ``randomness'' of a particular region: \qds{} in regions of anomalously high density demonstrate significantly richer behavior---a proximity induced localization effect.

Borrowing from standard measures of localization (in which one calculates various integrals of $\vb{E}$ over the simulation volume), we have adapted the inverse participation ratio (IPR)  of the dot polarization as
\begin{equation}
  \text{IPR}(t) = \frac{\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^4}{\qty(\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^2)^2}
  \label{eq:ipr}
\end{equation}
to provide a quantitative description of these phenomena.
\Cref{fig:ipr} shows this quantity for the system in \cref{fig:polarization vis}.
The maximum IPR occurs some time after the pulse has passed through the system, suggesting strongly coupled \qds{} retain their polarization longer than their uncoupled neighbors. Moreover, this dynamical localization effect features oscillations, indicating that many-dot effects contribute to the dynamics within a relatively narrow spectral region.

\Cref{fig:tubes,fig:tube projection} depict $\abs{\rho_{01}(\vb{r})}^2$ for \num{10000} \qds{} distributed randomly throughout a right cylinder at various times.
The cylinder has a radius of \SI{0.2}{\micro\meter} and a length of \SI{4}{\micro\meter}, making it several wavelengths long but far shorter than the incident pulse.
The incident $\vb{k}_L$ lies along the cylindrical axis, perpindicular to $\vb{d}$.
We observe effects from both near- and far-field radiation patterns; adjacent \qds{} strongly couple just like those in \cref{fig:density stats,fig:polarization vis}, though long-range effects additionally produce wavelength-scale patterns in the polarization intensity.
Identical simulations run without interactions ($\mathcal{Z}^{(m)}_{ij} = 0$) produce completely homogeneous polarization distributions as the pulse varies little over the length of the cylinder.

    We observe nearfield coupling phenomena in small groups of \qds{} that appear irregularly bright or dark; the farfield term of \cref{eq:radiated envelope} also produces localized hotspots of enhanced polarization.
