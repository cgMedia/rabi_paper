Here we detail the results of investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thus far.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume experiencing a laser pulse of the form
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_L(\vb{r}, t) = \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{-(\vb{k}_L \cdot \vb{r} - \omega_L t)^2/(2\sigma^2)}.
  \label{eq:pulse envelope}
\end{equation}
\Cref{table:parameters} provides the physical system parameters unless otherwise stated.


\begin{figure}

  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and a 1024-particle neighborhood (dots (1) and (2) maintain their separation and orientation between simulations).
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly diminished response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (omitted for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscillatory modes in the evolution of selected \qds{} (shown in gray).
    Note that $\rho_{00}^{\qty(1)}$ and $\rho_{00}^{\qty(2)}$ appear to have \emph{two} coherent modes in the presence of multiple dots: a high-frequency oscillation between the pair, as well as a low-frequency oscillation of the group about a decaying envelope.
}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:density stats} details $\rho_{00}(t)$ for two-, and 1024-particle simulations shown against a solution of \cref{eq:rotating liouville} for a \qd{} evolving according to $\tilde{\vb{E}}_L(\vb{r}, t)$ alone.
The system in \cref{fig:density stats}(a) contains two \qds{} with a separation of \SI{6.3}{\nano\meter} perpendicular to their mutual $\vb{d}$ to ensure that the dynamics arise almost entirely to the near-field term of \cref{eq:radiated envelope}.
The two \qds{} in this system very nearly follow the same trajectory and both excite far less than either would in response to the incident laser alone.
We note that this suppression effect occured to varying degrees for all near-field arrangements of two \qds{} that we investigated.
In \cref{fig:density stats}(b), the system contains the same two-dot arrangement as in (a), however we have added an additional 1024 \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a $\SI{6.4e-2}{\micro\meter\cubed}$ cube centered around the original pair.
Most of these additional \qd{} populations deviate very little from those produced by the laser-only pulse due to the relatively large separation between particles.
However, as we have filled the cube randomly, some regions of the system contain localized clusters of \qds{} that produce the suppression effect detailed above (for two adjacent particles) or populations with higher frequency oscillations (in the case of clusters with three or more \qds{}).
Specifically, the two ``original'' \qds{} acquire an out-of-phase oscillation with respect to each other as well as a lower frequency in-phase oscillation of the pair about a decaying envelope.

    1024 \qds{} illuminated by a $\pi$-pulse largely follow a trajectory determined by the pulse, though exceptionally close pairs/groups can maintain a polarized state far longer than the rest of the system.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:polarization vis} details the polarization distribution in a simulation in both space and time.
Here, ten thousand \qds{} randomly fill a $\SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter}$ box and inherit the remainder of their parameters from the simulation detailed above.
This simulation contains coupling/screening features similar to those in \cref{fig:density stats},
though \cref{fig:visit} further reveals the mechanism behind these phenomena.
Regions of high polarization (indicated as large points) appear clustered together, suggesting the coupling/screening behavior depends strongly on the geometry or ``randomness'' of a particular region: \qds{} in regions of anomalously high density demonstrate significantly richer behavior---a proximity induced localization effect.

Borrowing from standard measures of localization (in which one calculates various integrals of $\vb{E}$ over the simulation volume), we have adapted the inverse participation ratio (IPR)  of the dot polarization as
\begin{equation}
  \text{IPR}(t) = \frac{\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^4}{\qty(\sum_\ell \abs{\vb{p}_\ell(t)}^2)^2}
  \label{eq:ipr}
\end{equation}
to provide a quantitative description of these phenomena.
\Cref{fig:ipr} shows this quantity for the system in \cref{fig:polarization vis}.
The maximum IPR occurs some time after the pulse has passed through the system, suggesting strongly coupled \qds{} retain their polarization longer than their uncoupled neighbors. Moreover, this dynamical localization effect features oscillations, indicating that many-dot effects contribute to the dynamics within a relatively narrow spectral region.

\Cref{fig:tubes,fig:tube projection} depict $\abs{\rho_{01}(\vb{r})}^2$ for \num{10000} \qds{} distributed randomly throughout a right cylinder at various times.
The cylinder has a radius of \SI{0.2}{\micro\meter} and a length of \SI{4}{\micro\meter}, making it several wavelengths long but far shorter than the incident pulse.
The incident $\vb{k}_L$ lies along the cylindrical axis, perpindicular to $\vb{d}$.
We observe effects from both near- and far-field radiation patterns; adjacent \qds{} strongly couple just like those in \cref{fig:density stats,fig:polarization vis}, though long-range effects additionally produce wavelength-scale patterns in the polarization intensity.
Identical simulations run without interactions ($\mathcal{Z}^{(m)}_{ij} = 0$) produce completely homogeneous polarization distributions as the pulse varies little over the length of the cylinder.

    We observe nearfield coupling phenomena in small groups of \qds{} that appear irregularly bright or dark; the farfield term of \cref{eq:radiated envelope} also produces localized hotspots of enhanced polarization.
