Here we detail the results of several investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thusfar.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume at densities similar to those found in experiments, and \cref{table:parameters} gives approximate values of the system parameters.

  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and a 1024-particle neighborhood (dots (1) and (2) maintain their separation and orientation between simulations).
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly diminished response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (omitted for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscilliatory modes in the evolution of select \qds{} (shown in gray).

\Cref{fig:density stats} details the $\rho_{00}$ trajectory for a two- and 1024-particle simulation.
In two-particle simulations, we observe significant departures from the trajectories predicted by solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} for a prescribed external $\vb{E}_0(\vb{r}, t)$ exclusively.
The interaction between two \qds{} consistently ``screens'' the external field due to a dynamical detuning produced in the multiplet, leading to a greatly diminished response without notable oscillations.
The results of larger simulations appear considerably more interesting, however, due to the presence of many-body effects.

  \caption{\label{fig:polarization vis}Spatial distribution of polarization (indicated by $\abs{\tilde{\rho}_{01}}$ in both size and color) after a $\pi$-pulse has excited the system.
  While the distribution of $\abs{\vb{P}}$ varies significantly between dots, the regions of distinctly high and low polarization indicate localization phenomena arising from their electromagnetic interaction.}
