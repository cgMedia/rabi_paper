\end{table}

Here we detail the results of several investigations into coupled \qd{} behavior with the model presented thusfar.
Our algorithm reliably handles tens of thousands of \qds{} and can simulate ten picoseconds of system dynamics in two days on a single processor.
We perform simulations of systems of \qds{} randomly distributed throughout a simulation volume at densities similar to those found in experiments, and \cref{table:parameters} gives approximate values of the system parameters.

\begin{figure}
  \input{figures/density_stats}
  \caption{\label{fig:density stats}Population dynamics of adjacent \qds{} (top, shown with the trajectory of a \qd{} driven exclusively by the external laser in black) and a 1024-particle neighborhood (dots (1) and (2) maintain their separation and orientation between simulations).
    The interaction between particles gives a greatly diminished response to the external pulse through a dynamical detuning of the two-dot system.
    The majority of the neighboring particles in the 1024-dot system follow trajectories nearly identical to that prescribed by the laser (omitted for clarity); many-body effects, however, produce significant oscilliatory modes in the evolution of select \qds{} (shown in gray).
    Note that $\rho_{00}^{\qty(1)}$ and $\rho_{00}^{\qty(2)}$ appear to have \emph{two} coherent modes in the presence of multiple dots: a high-frequency oscillation between the pair, as well as a low-frequency oscillation of the group about a decaying envelope.

\Cref{fig:density stats} details $\rho_{00}(t)$ for one-, two-, and 1024-particle simulations.
The \qds{} fill a $\SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.4}{\micro\meter}$ box; experience a \SI{1}{\pico\second} laser pulse calibrated as a so-called ``$\pi$-pulse'' for perfectly resonant, undamped \qds{}; and otherwise use the parameters given in \cref{table:parameters}.

The two-particle simulations produce significant departures from the trajectories predicted by solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} with a prescribed external $\vb{E}_0(\vb{r}, t)$ alone.
The interaction between two \qds{} consistently ``screens'' the external field leading to a greatly diminished response without notable oscillations.
The results of larger simulations appear considerably more interesting (\cref{fig:density stats}(b)) due to the presence of many-body interactions.
The highlighted trajectories in \cref{fig:density stats}(b) contain a number of frequency components not present in the incident radiation or the dynamics of a two-particle system.
Moreover, the shaded neighbor $\rho_{00}(t)$ show many-body coupling interactions (in the curves with distinct oscillations) as well as additional screening effects (in the curves that deviate very little from $1$).

  While the distribution of $\abs{\vb{P}}$ varies significantly between dots, the regions of distinctly high and low polarization indicate localization phenomena arising from their electromagnetic interaction.}

\Cref{fig:polarization vis} details the polarization distribution in a large-scale \textcolor{red}{Replace with 10k figure---simulations in progress} simulation in both space and time.
Here, ten thousand \qds{} randomly fill a $\SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter} \times \SI{0.8}{\micro\meter}$ box and inherit the remainder of their parameters from the simulation detailed above.

\Cref{fig:visit src} contains coupling/screening features similar to those in \cref{fig:density stats}.
Plotting the spatial distribution of $\abs*{\tilde{\vb{P}}}$ gives some indication as to the mechanism behind these phenomena---
\begin{equation}
  \text{IPR} \equiv \frac{\displaystyle \int \abs*{\tilde{\vb{P}}}^4 \dd[3]\vb{r}}{\displaystyle \qty(\int \abs*{\tilde{\vb{P}}}^2 \dd[3]\vb{r})^2}
  \label{eq:ipr}
\end{equation}
