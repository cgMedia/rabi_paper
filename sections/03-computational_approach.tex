\section{Computational approach}

\subsection{The rotating-wave approximation}

Models of lone \qds{} or \qd{} ensembles in which the separation between dots far exceeds a typical interaction length (perhaps through a finite-difference time-domain grid) often use a rotating-wave approximation to great effect in eliminating high-frequency terms in the solution to \cref{eq:liouville} with only a small change in the resulting dynamics.
Assuming the incident radiation takes the form $\vb{E}(t) = \tilde{\vb{E}}(t) \cos(\omega_L t)$
where $\tilde{\vb{E}}(t)$ represents a slowly-varying envelope function, we introduce a unitary transformation $\tilde{\rho} = \hat{U} \hat{\rho} \hat{U}^\dagger$ where $\hat{U} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i \omega_L t})$ to produce a rotating-frame version of \cref{eq:liouville},
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\tilde{\rho}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - i \hbar \hat{V}}{\tilde{\rho}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}\qty[\tilde{\rho}]; \quad \hat{V} \equiv \hat{U} \pdv{\hat{U}^\dagger}{t},
  \label{eq:rotating liouville}
\end{equation}
motivating $\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - i \hbar \hat{V} \equiv \tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ as a ``rotating-frame Hamiltonian.''
By neglecting the $e^{i \qty(\omega_0 + \omega_L) t}$ terms under the assumption that they oscillate quickly and will therefore integrate out over any appreciable timescales, we produce a governing equation much more amenable to numerical integration as it contains only smooth (low-frequency) quantities.

A similar transformation applies to the source distribution in \cref{eq:total field}.
Writing $\vb{P}(\vb{r}, t) = \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}, t)e^{i \omega_L t}$, the radiated field envelope becomes
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \tilde{\vb{E}}_\text{rad}(\vb{r}, t) = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int 
    \qty(I -  \hat{\vb{r}}\hat{\vb{r}}) \cdot \frac{\qty(\partial_t^2 \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R) + 2 i \omega_L \partial_t \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R) - \omega_L^2 \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)) e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}}{\abs{\vb{r}-\vb{r}'}} + \\
    \qty(I - 3\hat{\vb{r}}\hat{\vb{r}}) \cdot \frac{c\qty(\partial_t \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R) + i \omega_L \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R))e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}}{\abs{\vb{r}-\vb{r}'}^2} +
    \qty(I - 3\hat{\vb{r}}\hat{\vb{r}}) \cdot \frac{c^2   \tilde{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}}{\abs{\vb{r}-\vb{r}'}^3}
    \, \dd[3]{\vb{r'}}.
  \end{gathered}
  \label{eq:radiated envelope}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
Critically, \cref{eq:radiated envelope} maintains the phase relationship between every pair of \qds{} via the $e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}$ factors that appear.
Because of this, we may freely take arbitrarily large timesteps in solving \cref{eq:rotating liouville} while still maintaining accurate interference patterns at each \qd{}.




\subsection{Solution of the Liouville equation}

Solving \cref{eq:liouville} for each of $n_s$ \qds{} amounts to solving $n_s$ coupled first-order differential equations in time.
The coupling term in \cref{eq:hamiltonian} and the retardation factor in \cref{eq:total field} add additional complexity, however, making ``straightforward'' solution methods (such as RK4 or other midstep methods) ill-suited for the problem at hand.
Due to its extreme accuracy and inherent bandlimitedness, we make use of the highly-tuned predictor/corrector scheme detailed in~\cite{Glaser2009} to numerically solve \cref{eq:liouville} for each \qd{} in the system.
\begin{equation}
  \rho_i(t) \approx \sum_{j = 1}^{n_\lambda} w_j e^{\lambda_j t}
\end{equation}
where each of the $\lambda_j$ take on appropriately chosen complex values, 

\begin{equation}
  \rho_i(t_{k + 1}) = \sum_{\ell = 1}^k \qty[\mathcal{P} \ell^{\qty(0)} \rho_i(t_i) + \mathcal{P} \ell^{\qty(1)} \dot{\rho}_i(t_i)]
\end{equation}


\subsection{Evaluation of radiated fields}

As the \qds{} in our system contain a discrete set of internal energy levels, they interact with only a narrow band of frequencies in the radiation field and we may treat $\vb{E}(t)$ as a slowly-varying envelope modulated by a sinusoid of frequency $\omega_L$:
\begin{equation}
  \vb{E}(t) = \tilde{\vb{E}}(t)\cos(\omega_L t).
  \label{eq:modulated field}
\end{equation}
