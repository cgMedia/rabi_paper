Rabi oscillations typify the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in \qds{}, and, in contrast to atoms, ensembles of \qds{} realize spatial configurations characterized by quenched randomness.
Using a highly efficient integral equation formulation to solve the 3D Maxwell-Bloch equations in ensembles of up to $10^4$ quantum dots, we observe features in the collective dynamics due to the interplay of nonlinearity, non-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots.
The approach allows us to observe the dynamics of each dot in the ensemble without resorting to spatial averages.
Our simulations predict synchronized multiplets of dots that exchange energy, dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect of incident external radiation, as well as localization of the polarization due to randomness and interactions. These results suggest new experimental strategies for isolating light-induced  dynamical quantum dot molecules in dot ensembles.
