Rabi oscillations, lacking a classical analogue, signify the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in \qds{}.
In contrast to atomic systems, ensembles of \qds{} realize spatial configurations characterized by quenched randomness.
Using a highly-efficient integral formulation to solve the 3D Maxwell-Bloch equations in an ensemble of $10^5$ quantum dots, we observe features in the collective dynamics due to the interplay of randomness-induced localization, non-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots.
In particular, our simulations predict localized multiplets of dots that exchange energy, as well as dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect of incident external radiation.
