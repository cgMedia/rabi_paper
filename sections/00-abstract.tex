Rabi oscillation is one of the key signatures of the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in quantum dots, and has no classical analogue. In contrast to atomic systems, ensembles of quantum dots realize spatial configurations characterized by quenched randomness. Using a highly-efficient integral formulation to solve 3D Maxwell-Bloch equations in an ensemble of 10$^5$ quantum dots, we observe features in the collective dynamics due to the interplay of  randomness-induced localization, non-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots. In particular, localized multiplets of dots that exchange energy, as well as dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect of the external excitation are observed.
