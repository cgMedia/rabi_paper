We thank the referee for his/her very useful comments.... 


* T1 time 10ps. This is very short, I am only aware of similarly short lifetimes under very strong Purcell enhancement. Have the authors chosen this because of computational restrictions?The referee is right...we should use something closer to 1 ns. However since we only simulated a few picoseconds we would not see any effect due to this.... we could say that we considered a case with very short lifetime to show the effects of the term.

* There are few references in the main text connected to derivation of the equations. For instance, where does eq3 come from? I think that I get it but a brief explanation or a reference would be nice.

Maybe cite some e\&m textbook or Landau vol 2?


* The real-world issue of inhomogeneously broadened quantum dot transition energies, dipole orientations, linewidths, decoherencerates, dipole orientations, and consequently also pi pulse areas, isnot discussed. Would observation of the proposed effects ever be possible? Note that there might be ways around this, such as cavity enhanced Raman interaction between quantum dots which probably does not require strict resonance condition.

We have investigated many of these things...we just did not say anything in the paper... mabe we could add more  calculations with inhomogeneous broadening....


* The authors study a ~1ps long optical pulse, but as far as I see in the RWA everything is monochromatic, while a 1ps pulse is not monochromatic. I feel that this should be discussed, probably it is not a problem but I don't know (even more so for the fs time scale in the last figure).

We are using a time dependent formulation so the finite laser bandwith is correctly described. The RWA does not affect this.

* The effect of nonlocal effects on the population in Fig.2a is very strong. Can the authors compare/comfirm this result by comparing to other studies or experiments?


* Dimensionality: The authors study a 3D geometry with (e.g.) 1024 dots in 6.4e-2 um-3, which means that the dot separation is around 40nm. This might be doable but I wonder if anything could be seen in 2D, where currently much progress is done regarding narrowing of the inhomogeneous broadening.

Yes we could add a simulation in 2D....

 * Eqs. 3+5: is the dagger of r^\dagger correct? If so, what does it mean?Yes this is weird... r is just a classical real vector...

* About the intriguing isolated outliers in Fig 3+5: can the authors extend their explanation?

I think we already said that...maybe reiterate...

* Probably it would be good to mention what is means by "polarization" somewhere clearly (==coherences, |rho01|^2).

Same as above...
